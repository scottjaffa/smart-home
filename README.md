Home automation tinkering

# About this project
The goal of this project is to have a house that uses automation to provide quality of life functions, energy efficiency, manage environmental conditions (HVAC primarily), and satisfy my need to tinker.  On Shabbat (Jewish sabbath) or holidays, the house should switch to running a fully automated, schedule driven system which requires no human input or interaction.
